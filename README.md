💡 NLP-Based GATE Exam Preparation System with Proctored Environment & Result Analysis
📘 Project Overview
    This project is a comprehensive, AI-enhanced GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) preparation platform built to simulate a real exam environment with advanced      features such as secure online proctoring, NLP-powered chatbot support, centralized learning resources, and automated result analysis.
   🔐 Built for fairness. 🎯 Designed for focus. 🤖 Powered by AI.
 
  *Key Features
     🧠 Realistic GATE SimulationSupports 65-question formats including MCQ, MSQ, and NAT — replicating the actual GATE exam.
     🔒 AI-Based Proctoring System
     ✅ Face Recognition for identity verification
     👀 Movement Tracking using OpenCV
     📵 Object Detection via YOLOv3 to flag cheating attempts
     🚨 Real-time proctor alerts & flagging
     🤖 NLP-Powered Chatbot
     
    ***  Live assistance for syllabus, topics, notes, and guidance
    ***  Built using spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers, and NLTK
      📊 Automated Result Analysis
    ***  Score breakdown with topic-wise analytics
    *** Strengths/weaknesses & improvement recommendations
    ***  Adaptive learning suggestions
    🎓 Study Resource HubAccess to previous year papers, subject-wise notes, and curated video lectures.
